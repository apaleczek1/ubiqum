## General info
The project was carried out as part of the first phase of the Data Analytics / Big Data 2020b Ubiqum bootcamp, in which I participated as part of the Santander scholarship. The project includes preliminary data analysis, feature extraction and selection, and binary classification using Python and Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, XGBoost libraries.

The main purpose of these analyzes is to understand and discover the behavior of customers in online and in-store shopping from different regions. One of the tasks set by the client was age prediction based on the region. Another dependence that played a large role for the customer and understanding the behavior of buyers was the prediction whether the customer will buy the product online or in the store based on the collected demographic data.
